# Treehouse WebDev Project 8
## Connect to and Use a Public API

Communicating with APIs allows you to work with microservices and vast databases to quickly and easily build useful tools and relevant information. You can build utilities, games, infographics, and more. You can also integrate, display, and analyze social media and large data sets without creating and curating them yourself.

For this project, you'll build an app for a fictional company called "Awesome Startup," a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need an intelligent way for employees to share contact information.

You'll use the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random "employees" and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.

You'll request a JSON object from the API and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee's image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee's birthday and address.

You may use jQuery with this project, but other frameworks, libraries, or plugins are not permitted. While there are plugins that can help create a gallery and modal setup, developers need to understand how tools like that work "under the hood." So you'll need to write all your JavaScript or jQuery to create the necessary functionality for this project.

After building this project, you'll have yet another excellent portfolio piece to show off and demonstrate your incredible skills, which will include working with public APIs, making API requests, and asynchronously handling data returned from client requests and displayed in an app.
